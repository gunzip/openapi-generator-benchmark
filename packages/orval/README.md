## Works on our specs

For some odd reason it looks like it does not generate the client at all.

## Generate server types

- Loosy typescript types

- Basic zod types only for active APIs
  (not for all definitions)

## Has runtime checks

## Code quality and extensibility

## Footprint

## Dependencies

## Supports

- pattern: yes

- enum: no

- max/min: yes

- allof: yes

- oneof: yes

- dates: yes

- binary: ??

- securityDefinitions: no

## Conclusion

Let you provide custom http client, but it's not clear
how to use with zod. Typescript and zod types aren't related.
